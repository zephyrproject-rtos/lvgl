	  Size of the smallest block in the memory pool in bytes

	  Size of the largest block in the memory pool in bytes

	int "Rendering buffer size"
	default 10

	help
	  Size of the buffer used for rendering screen content as a percentage
	  of total display size.

config LV_Z_DOUBLE_VDB
	bool "Use two rendering buffers"
	help
	  Use two buffers to render and flush data in parallel

config LV_Z_FULL_REFRESH
	bool "Force full refresh mode"
	help
	  Force full refresh of display on update. When combined with
	  LV_Z_VDB_SIZE, this setting can improve performance for display
	  controllers that require a framebuffer to be present in system memory,
	  since the controller can render the LVGL framebuffer directly

config LV_Z_VDB_ALIGN
	int "Rending buffer alignment"
	default 4
	depends on LV_Z_BUFFER_ALLOC_STATIC
	help
	  Rendering buffer alignment. Depending on chosen color depth,
	  buffer may be accessed as a uint8_t *, uint16_t *, or uint32_t *,
	  so buffer must be aligned to prevent unaligned memory access

config LV_Z_VBD_CUSTOM_SECTION
	bool "Link rendering buffers to custom section"
	depends on LV_Z_BUFFER_ALLOC_STATIC
	help
	  Place LVGL rendering buffers in custom section, with tag ".lvgl_buf".
	  This can be used by custom linker scripts to relocate the LVGL
	  rendering buffers to a custom location, such as tightly coupled or
	  external memory.
choice
	prompt "Rendering Buffer Allocation"
	default LV_Z_BUFFER_ALLOC_STATIC
	help
	  Type of allocation that should be used for allocating rendering buffers

config LV_Z_BUFFER_ALLOC_STATIC
	bool "Static"
	help
	  Rendering buffers are statically allocated based on the following
	  configuration parameters:
	  * Horizontal screen resolution
	  * Vertical screen resolution
	  * Rendering buffer size
	  * Bytes per pixel

config LV_Z_BUFFER_ALLOC_DYNAMIC
	bool "Dynamic"
	help
	  Rendering buffers are dynamically allocated based on the actual
	  display parameters
